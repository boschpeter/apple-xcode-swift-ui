Browsers are sure helpful, but you should only install one at a time. Since the browser uses a lot of RAM power, make sure to limit only a single installation that satisfies all your needs.

I personally use the Google Chrome browser that syncs across devices using the Google account. It helps in browsing, streaming, web development, and maintaining the historical record sync across multi-devices.

If you canâ€™t replace the Safari browser. So make sure to uninstall others after use. And if you like one particular browser like chrome or firefox, then make sure to sync the stored passwords and bookmarks from your old browser for a seamless browsing experience.
